# Slidely task02  Frontend  

This repository houses the codebase for the frontend component of a Windows desktop application, specifically designed to fulfill the requirements of Slidely Task 2. The primary objective of this project is to develop a Windows desktop application utilizing the Visual Basic language, which will interact with a backend system by sending requests and receiving responses. Additionally, the application is capable of collecting and transmitting user data to the backend, enabling seamless communication between the client-side and server-side components. The application will then display the received data in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner, leveraging the capabilities of Windows Forms to provide an intuitive user experience.

2. Then open project with visual studio it  will take 1 minute approx as IDE is heavy. Then open file with
